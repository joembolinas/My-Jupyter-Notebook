    "We will:\n",
    "1. Set up necessary libraries.\n",
    "2. Create sample log files (based on the article's examples).\n",
    "3. Implement the Python parsing script.\n",
    "4. Run the script on the sample logs.\n",
    "5. Examine the output.\n",
    "6. Briefly discuss next steps for `log2.txt` and `log3.txt`."
